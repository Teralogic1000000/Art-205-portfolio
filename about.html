My name is Wisdom Abundance Kar, a Liberian creative with a growing 
passion for technology, design, and building meaningful digital
experiences. I was born and raised in Monrovia, where my journey has shaped 
my resilience, focus, and deep desire to create work that makes an impact

I am currently studying Information Technology, while activily 
building my skills in graphic design, branding, UI layouts, and 
emerging web technologies. Over the years, I've worked 
on real projects from church presentation designs, event flyers,\
and branding pieces, to admin portal layouts and websites
for small businesses. Each project has sharpened my eye for detail,
strengthened my creativity, and fueled my commitment to excellence.
